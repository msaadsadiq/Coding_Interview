# Coding_Interview
C++ and Python solutions to most common coding interview and machine learning problems in one place

Following are the problems that this repository solves

1. non repeating character
2. One away strings 
3. is this a binary search tree
4. track the frequency of common words.
5. number of strings that are unique within the list
6. given an integer, write code to list all primes preceding it
7. finding maximum sum in a row in the interger array (contains minus)
8. Write a function that traverses a binary tree  
9. random number generator
10. reverse a string in-place  
11. Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.
12. find median for a stream
13. implement strstr using a linked list of linked lists.
14. find the Least common Ancestor of two nodes in a tree  
15. Checking completeness of binary tree
16. collapse a binary search tree into a sorted list  
17. code Encode N-ary Tree to Binary Tree
18. Implement an iterator for a binary search tree that will iterate the nodes by value in ascending order.  (tree traversal)
19. Reverse a C string that has a special character encoding. Special characters are two bytes and are preceded by a flag character represented by the highest bit being set to 1, then the following bits specifing how many special characters will follow. The special characters are be interspersed between normal characters.  
20. Write a code to add/subtract two linked lists that contained a digit each to represent huge numbers.
1 -> 4 -> 4 + 1 ->9 -> 5
1 -> 4 -> 4 - 1 ->9 -> 5  

21. Exchange the odd and even bits of an integer  
22. Find number of ones in an integer.
23. find the smallest number in an array (sort)
24. 1st repeated integer, recurring character
25. Derive prime numbers efficiently  
26. the most efficient way to determine if a number is a power of 2. returns true
27. write atoi function in c++  
28. Write a recursive function to determine prime number
29. 2 elements (two missing) from 1 to N, find the two missing elements in linear time and constant memory usage
30. Given a set of interval tuples, find the longest overlapping interval
31. find circular loop in linked list,
32. Nth element of a linked list
33. Assign numbers in minesweeper
34. Write code for writing to a circular buffer.
